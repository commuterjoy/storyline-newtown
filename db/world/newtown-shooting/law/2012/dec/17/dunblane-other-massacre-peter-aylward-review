These events have provoked millions of words of comment and analysis as mass murders inevitably do.</p><p>Such slaughters used to take place almost exclusively in the United States, where around 20 or so multiple shootings — albeit much smaller ones — take place every year but now, it seems, they could happen anywhere. When a young Russian, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/nov/08/russian-office-shooting-video\" title=\"\">Dmitry Vinogradov</a>, shot six people dead in Moscow last month, following a broken romance, we were reminded once again of the random nature of such violence and the law's attempts to understand it. What prompts it? Are the rogue gunmen mad or bad? How urgently do we need to talk about Kevin?</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/17/newtown-shootings-education-prevent-mass-killings\" title=\"\">Peter Aylward</a>, the author of a new book, Understanding Dunblane and Other Massacres, has impeccable qualifications for embarking on such a study. A Metropolitan police special branch officer between 1977 and 1992, he switched careers, graduated from the Foundation for Psychotherapy and Counselling and went on to specialise in forensic psychotherapy at Broadmoor hospital, where he has worked since 1996.</p><p>His primary focus has been the understanding of murder and, most recently, mass murder. As the introduction to the book makes clear, \"it is his fervent belief emanating from his extensive experience that all such mass killings can be understood if the perpetrator's history is examined in depth.\"</p><p>Thomas Watt Hamilton shot dead 16 children, a teacher and himself in the gym of Dunblane primary school in Scotland in 1996. Hamilton was described as \"a loner, unmarried, living in a ground floor council flat, unemployed, on benefits, with significant debts.\" He had no previous convictions, did not drink or smoke and no drugs were found in his system at the autopsy.</p><p>He had been expelled many years earlier from leading a Scout group after parents of boys in his charge expressed concerns. Subsequently, he set up and ran a number of boys' clubs and camps until, once again, his behaviour — \"old-fashioned\" discipline, photographing the boys in the black swimming trunks he insisted they wore as a form of uniform — again raised concerns amongst parents. Rumours about him spread to his increasing consternation.</p><p>Six days before the rampage, Hamilton, by now a prolific and indignant letter-writer in his own defence, wrote to the Queen, his MP, a local councillor and local head-teachers: \"I turn to you as a last resort and am appealing for some kind of intervention in the hope that I may be able to regain my self-esteem in society.\" Could any \"intervention\" have been made much earlier that would have prevented the Dunblane massacre and others like it? Aylward believes that it could have been and that, in the long term, such murderous rampages could be reduced or even eliminated.</p><p>Hamilton's background was complex. He was adopted by his mother's adoptive parents and grew up believing that his mother was his sister. His father abandoned him. Aylward explores this background and its similarity to that of Brievik, whose parents also parted early: \"both were considered a little odd and not part of the mainstream, giving the impression that they struggled with achieving a sense of belonging ... each met with his mother the night before the attack.\"</p><p>There are, of course, countless \"misfits\" and \"loners\" around the world, some of whose fathers may have departed in infancy, and some of whom may be regarded as odd but hardly any of them get hold of a gun and kill strangers. What made Hamilton so different?</p><p>Aylward makes the analogy of a combination lock \"to explain the sequence of events that are required for a murderous act to be unleashed, not unlike the exact sequence of numbers for the lock to snap open.\" He believes that some of the numbers were in place from Hamilton's unresolved childhood traumas and others — public ridicule, huge debt — started to snap into place.</p><p>What's to be done? Aylward reckons that the teaching of the traditional three Rs needs to be joined by a fourth. \"I believe we need to educate the next generation of mothers and fathers, starting at the earliest place of schooling and continuing it right up to the sixth form and on to university, about relationships ... Inoculating future parents with insight is, I believe, the key.\" He quotes HG Wells's assertion that history is a race between education and catastrophe but one doubts that Michael Gove will see fit to add to the curriculum the study of relationships, although Aylward has written to an advisor to the education secretary on the subject.</p><p>Hamilton and the Connecticut gunman, Adam Lanza, both killed themselves at the scene but what should happen to surviving perpetrators? Aylward says that Breivik requires both punishment and treatment. His book accepts that future massacres are \"sadly inevitable\" as individuals commit such acts as a corollary to feeling \"uncontained, excluded and emasculated.\" More dark nights ahead.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401219676|2012-12-22T11:49:03Z|f7851ef7812b36384d02714a52c2d2847ae38470 -->","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2012-12-17T16:43:13Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","score":"1.0","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/17/1355760922214/The-people-of-Dunblane-qu-003.jpg","standfirst":"2012 has seen the Newtown shooting, Anders Breivik trial and Aurora killings.
