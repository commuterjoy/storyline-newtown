Cerberus said it was not the company's role to enter the debate but added: \"There are, however, actions that we as a firm can take. \"Accordingly, we have determined to immediately engage in a formal process to sell our investment in Freedom Group.\" </p><p>\"As a firm, we are investors, not statesmen or policy makers. Our role is to make investments on behalf of our clients, who are comprised of the pension plans of firemen, teachers, policemen and other municipal workers and unions, endowments, and other institutions and individuals. It is not our role to take positions, or attempt to shape or influence the gun control policy debate. That is the job of our federal and state legislators.\"</p><p>Cerberus, which was founded by Feinberg, an avid shooter and hunter, in 1992, said it was \"shocked and deeply saddened\" by the shooting on Friday and it \"cannot comprehend the losses suffered by the families and friends of those killed by the unthinkable crimes\". The investment fund had built Freedom Group into America's biggest manufacturer of semi-automatics with a series of company acquisitions, including Remington Arms and Bushmaster Firemaster, which made the .223 Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle – the one believed to have been used by Lanza. </p><p>In its latest financial statement, Freedom said the market for military-type weapons grew by 27% between 2007 and 2011. \"The continued adoption of the modern sporting rifle has led to increased growth in the long gun market, especially with a younger demographic of users and those who like to customise or upgrade their firearms,\" it said.</p><p>Freedom said the increase in demand would have \"significant long-term benefits\" for the firm. It reported a 43% rise in profits before interest and tax and other charges to $118m in the nine months to the end of September. Over the same period sales increased by 19% to $677m. </p><p>Freedom sold 1.2m rifles and 2.6bn rounds of ammunition in the 12 months ended March 2010, the most recent year for which figures are publicly available. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last year it said: \"We believe our scale and product breadth are unmatched within the industry.\" </p><p>The company recently appointed two senior retired generals - George Joulwan, formerly supreme allied commander of Europe, and Michael Hagee, formerly commandant of the Marine Corps - to its board. Cerberus, which is headquartered on Park Avenue in Manhattan, also boasts Dan Quayle, a former vice president, as the chairman of its global investment group.</p><p>George Kollitides, Freedom's chairman and interim chief executive, has tried unsuccessfully to run for a seat on the board of the National Rifle Association (NRA), the powerful pro-gun lobbying group. </p><p>Last month Freedom's finance director Ronald Kolka, disclosed that it had donated $2m to the NRA. He also told analysts that the re-election of Barack Obama had caused a \"very, very positive effect on our business\" because of fears Obama would crack down on guns. </p><p>Obama told a vigil in Newtown on Sunday: \"We can't tolerate this any more.
