She lives in a rural region some miles from where the campus is located. Their anger, she explained, stemmed not from the killings themselves but from the threat the attack posed to their right to bear arms.</p><p>&quot;They're furious with us,&quot; she told me. &quot;They think we should have found a way to prevent it.&quot;</p><p>I wasn't particularly surprised by her neighbors' resentment. I have lived in the American South for three decades, longer than I lived in the UK, where I was brought up; I have taught creative writing at Virginia Tech for over 25 years. I have grown to love this country very much. But America's unhealthy obsession with guns threatens to tear it apart.</p><p>This week, only three days after the Oregon mall shootings in which two people were killed, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/15/newtown-shooting-victims-names-released\">Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut became the latest target</a>. This time, 28 people were killed, 20 of whom were little children.</p><p>It has fallen to President Obama – a man already targeted by the NRA as un-American – to tackle this issue. After hearing the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/14/obama-meaningful-action-newtown-shooting\">president speak about these horrific shootings</a>, I have little doubt that he's determined to open the Pandora's Box of gun control. He's likely to call for a reinstatement of the ban on assault weapons and to push for comprehensive background checks on all gun purchases, thus closing the infamous gunshow loophole.</p><p>To those in other parts of the world, these seem like modest proposals. But in America, they're incendiary.</p><p>To understand why this is such a contentious issue, we have to understand the gun culture, particularly in the South. In addition, we have to understand the emphasis placed on individual freedom in the US, even when that freedom may pose a threat to the community.</p><p>In <a href=\"http://lucindaroy.net/books\">No Right to Remain Silent</a>, a book I wrote about what we can learn from the tragedy at Virginia Tech, one of the things I examined was the role guns play in American culture. Several friends warned me against tying guns to school shootings, saying the backlash could be extreme.</p><p>But I had worked with the perpetrator Seung-Hui Cho two years before the tragedy, and tried, unsuccessfully, to get help for him. How could I ignore the fact that he'd used a 9mm Glock and a .22-caliber Walther to carry out his execution-style murders? Or that he'd fired 174 rounds of ammunition in 11 minutes? With his guns, Cho didn't have to play the role of the silent, struggling student anymore; he could become a scourge.</p><p>Semi-automatic handguns, high-powered rifles, and assault weapons are some of the most popular characters in American drama, the co-stars of almost every blockbuster action movie. Those who wield the largest guns, be they heroic protagonists or disturbed antagonists, become larger than life, omnipotent.</p><p>We underestimate the fascination guns hold for young people. We fail to appreciate how they can become the catalyst for a chilling metamorphosis. </p><p>Cho was the most silent student I have worked with in 30 years.
