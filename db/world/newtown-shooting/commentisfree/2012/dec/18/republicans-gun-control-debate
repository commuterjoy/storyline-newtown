You might think that Republicans resorted to this action because they sensed that the country was turning against their position. Now, it appears that the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/18/nyregion/silent-since-shootings-nra-could-face-challenge-to-political-power.html?_r=0\">National Rifle Association (NRA) has gone conspicuously silent, too</a>. What's going on? </p><p>Remember that Republicans and the NRA share similar policy positions: 89% of Republican senators <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/12/17/where-the-senate-stands-on-guns-in-one-chart/\">receive at least an A rating</a> from the NRA; they also receive <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000000082\">88% of the NRA's political contributions</a>. Republicans in Congress are, for the most part, in favor of the same positions on gun control as the NRA. </p><p>Recognize, too, that Republicans and pro-gun Democrats have made tremendous strides over the past ten years. From the ending of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban\">federal assault weapons ban</a> to the supreme court's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller\">reversal of many gun control measures in Washington, DC</a>, to the legalisation of <a href=\"http://travel.usatoday.com/news/2010-11-30-amtrak-trains-guns_N.htm\">guns being transported on Amtrak trains</a>, almost all policies put in place have been against those arguing for stronger gun safety legislation. </p><p>Public opinion also has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/15/newtown-shooting-tighter-gun-control-laws\">shifting against gun control</a>. The majority of Americans had – before Newtown – moved for the first time in modern history against stricter gun control. Some individual gun control measures poll higher, but they, too, have been polling at their lowest levels. Even in the wake of Newtown, the shift toward gun safety policies has been <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/12/17/poll-sandy-hook-shooting-a-sign-of-big-societal-problems/\">relatively muted</a>.</p><p>Pro-gun positions have become the default position for any politician running in the south. Gone are the days where Democrats from Republican states, like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwjo_MNdRT0\">Bob Kerrey</a>, could forcefully argue for gun control. West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, who now wants to <a href=\"http://tv.msnbc.com/2012/12/17/nra-endorsed-sen-joe-manchin-calls-for-assault-weapons-ban/\">have a discussion</a> about gun control, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIJORBRpOPM\">actually shot up a piece of legislation</a> in a famous ad, when public opinion polls were turning against him for his 2010 bid for the United States Senate. </p><p>All this is to say that the prospect of preserving the status quo looks very good for those who oppose gun control. It remains to be seen whether a single traumatic event like the Newtown tragedy can really mobilise public opinion to break the powerful grip the gun rights lobby has on the political establishment.</p><p>The problem for those in favor of gun control is that Newtown's effects are likely to be short-lived. Americans rely on the media to keep issues on their minds. Past gun massacres have failed to alter the media's normal attention span, as this graph from <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/12/16/the-media-will-quickly-forget-about-guns-unless-washington-stops-them/\">Danny Hayes</a> illustrates:</p><figure><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/18/1355856225632/mediashootings_460.jpg' alt='Media attention and shootings' width='460' height='325' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The one massacre that was different in terms of media coverage was Columbine. It was the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/14/gun-control-polling-sandy-hook_n_2303409.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000009\">No 1 news story</a> for 1999. Not surprisingly, it was the only event over the past 15 years that gave gun control positions a strong bump in the polls. So, what do these past examples tell us?</p><p>Pro-gun Republicans and the NRA are playing very smart politics right now, given that they seem <a href=\"http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/12/17/will-there-be-gun-control-legislation/\">unlikely to change their positions</a>. Republicans' strategy will be to have Newtown and talk of gun control disappear from the news as quickly as possible. As Hayes notes, \"policy issues tend to receive sustained attention only when the parties are engaged in loud, public conflict.\"</p><p>The way to ensure that Newtown receives rapidly diminishing news coverage beyond this first round is to do next to nothing: by refusing to play ball with the press on the issue, Republicans deprive the press from keeping the story going when there really isn't any overt conflict between the two policy sides. Republicans will also be minimizing the chance of someone making an unfortunate, Todd Akin-like statement that might display a lack of empathy with Newtown's victims.</p><p>So Republicans are doing exactly what the political playbook says they should. If the new round of post-Newtown polling is as anti-gun as Americans are going to get any time soon, then pro-gun politicians can ride it out without coming under pressure to pass major legislation.</p><p>Gun-safety Democrats' job, then, will be to keep Newtown in the news cycle. They have been on the losing side of the gun issue for the past deacde and more. They need something dramatic to change in order to get major legislation passed, especially with Republicans in charge of the House of Representatives.</p><p>If, however, the media moves along to other issues – back to the fiscal cliff, for instance – then support for gun control will return to its default decline.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401297041|2012-12-22T11:49:02Z|e20776d5753e6574d0a4c427406beddd69b367df -->","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2012-12-18T21:06:19Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","score":"1.0","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/18/1355856773518/Wayne-LaPierre-CEO-of-the-003.jpg","standfirst":"Republican lawmakers and their NRA backers are sticking to the playbook: say as little as possible, wait for the media to move on","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3cj29","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/18/1355856773518/Wayne-LaPierre-CEO-of-the-003.jpg","wordcount":"727","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"401297041","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Harry J Enten","publication":"guardian.co.uk","internalPageCode":"1844433","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-12-21T18:57:00Z"},"tags":[{"id":"global/series/on-polling-and-politics-2012","type":"series","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webTitle":"On polling and politics 2012","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/series/on-polling-and-politics-2012","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global/series/on-polling-and-politics-2012","references":[]},{"id":"world/newtown-shooting","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Newtown shooting","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newtown-shooting","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/newtown-shooting","references":[]},{"id":"world/democrats","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Democrats","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/democrats","references":[]},{"id":"world/republicans","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Republicans","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/republicans","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/republicans","references":[]},{"id":"world/us-politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"US politics","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-politics","references":[]},{"id":"world/nra","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"NRA","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nra","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/nra","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"United States","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/gun-control","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"US gun control","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/gun-control","references":[]},{"id":"world/congress","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"US Congress","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congress","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/congress","references":[]},{"id":"world/house-of-representatives","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"US House of Representatives","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/house-of-representatives","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/house-of-representatives","references":[]},{"id":"media/media","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/media","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/media","references":[]},{"id":"media/us-press-publishing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"US press and publishing","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/us-press-publishing","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/us-press-publishing","references":[]},{"id":"profile/harry-j-enten","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Harry J Enten","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/harry-j-enten","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/harry-j-enten","references":[],"bio":"<p>Harry J Enten blogs about political and electoral statistics at <a href=\"http://marginoferror.org/\">Margin of Error</a>.
