In dramatic terms, Long's post describes how she decided to take her son to a mental hospital after he pulled a knife and threatened to kill first her and then himself. The most depressing detail in her piece is the social worker's response when Long enquires about her options – she's told to charge her son with a crime: \"No one will pay attention to you unless you've got charges.\" She concludes:</p><p></p><p><blockquote>\"I am sharing this story because I am Adam Lanza's mother. I am Dylan Klebold's and Eric Harris's mother. I am James Holmes's mother. I am Jared Loughner's mother. I am Seung-Hui Cho's mother. And these boys – and their mothers – need help. In the wake of another horrific national tragedy, it's easy to talk about guns. But it's time to talk about mental illness.\"</blockquote></p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://sarahkendzior.com/2012/12/16/want-the-truth-behind-i-am-adam-lanzas-mother-read-her-blog/\" title=\"\">Another viral blogpost by Sarah Kendzior</a>, has taken issue with Long's piece, criticising her for capitalising on the Newtown tragedy. As several people have pointed out, at this stage we know too little about Lanza to speculate about his wellbeing, let alone motives.</p><p></p><p>But many other commenters agree that there is an urgent need for a debate not just on gun control, but also on mental health.

Make it much easier for a family to get a potentially dangerous person into mandated treatment. This means less paperwork, too. We need to support parents and mental health professionals.\"</blockquote></p><p></p><p>In the British blogosphere, there has been more reluctance to tie the shootings to mental health. Birmingham police inspector Michael Brown, who tweets at @MentalHealthCop, calls Long's blog \"<a href=\"http://mentalhealthcop.wordpress.com/2012/12/17/newtown/\" title=\"\">potentially the worst article I have ever read about mental health and violence</a>\" and insists that at this stage, the mental health debate is a red herring:</p><p></p><p><blockquote>\"Whether the issue being raised in Liza's description of her own son's behaviour were mental illnesses or other behavioural/educational problems is … not clear and a matter of taxonomy which varies from country to country. Some UK Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) will not accept referrals for 'oppositional defiant disorder' or 'intermittently explosive disorder': not unless accompanied by additional psychiatric issues. So is the request here for better mental healthcare, or specialist educational/parenting support? Who knows – it is far from clear. No one questions that society should do all it can to support parents who struggle with parenting challenges, but we should be wary of over-medicalising the issues. Research suggests this can makes things worse.\"</blockquote></p><p></p><p>Emily Willingham, a writer and editor with an autistic son, <a href=\"http://www.emilywillinghamphd.com/2012/12/autism-empathy-and-violence-one-of.html\" title=\"\">has similarly criticised those who have singled out Lanza's supposed autism as the \"cause\" of the killings</a>:</p><p></p><p><blockquote>\"Planned, social violence is not a feature of autism. Indeed, autistic people are far more likely to have violence done against them than to do violence to others … If Lanza turns out to have been someone on the spectrum, I'd like to remind everyone that autism is not an explanatory factor in his actions. And that autistic people like my son are fully, fully capable of empathising with those who were the target of them.\"</blockquote></p><p></p><p>Is it naive to focus the debate purely on gun control? Or is it still premature to talk about mental health in connection to the Newtown shootings?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark:
