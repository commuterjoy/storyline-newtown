It was largely his focus on personal stories, on individual pain and terror, that made his obsessive tweeting compelling, and that form the basis of his just-published book, Distant Witness: Social Media, the Arab Spring and a Journalism Revolution. \"Unflinching, real-time depiction of conflict\" is Carvin's metier, according to <a href=\"http://press.journalism.cuny.edu/book/distant-witness-social-media-the-arab-spring-and-a-journalism-revolution/\">the book's press notes</a>.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>[Carvin] is reinventing how people experience the news.

From a remote control booth, Carvin uses Twitter as a field walkie-talkie calling out to others, and then centralizing their reports. In theory, he's harnessing the eyes and ears of people actually on the ground, in sight of the carnage, and, as it were, disintermediating the outside cameras and hacks yet to arrived – or who might not ever arrive (aka parachuting reporters).</p><p>This is \"crowdsourcing\", that new notion of information collection and retrieval that has become a cliche even before its actual process has been much tested or entirely defined. Carvin is certainly a bona fide practitioner of a new form of journalism, inventing a role for himself that seems as native as the network anchorman became to television in the 1960s. (Carvin even has his own signature signoff before he stops tweeting for the night: \"Stay safe, everyone.\")</p><p>This successfully assumed identity seems to have compelled his employer, NPR, quite a traditional news organization, to have acknowledged his special standing with the awkward title, \"senior product manager for online communities\". As it happens, and perhaps the awkwardness of his title reflects NPR's discomfort here, Carvin himself has no journalism or reporting experience. He was a not-for-profit administrator involved with digital issues, primarily how to expand public computing resources to those without, when he started to focus on computing's role in mass events – a good way to promote the importance of computers for all.</p><p>Carvin's interest has never been reporting, per se, or storytelling, or even, in the manner of the untrained war reporter, experiencing the reality for himself. Rather, his vocation, along with promoting social media itself, has been that new information role called \"curation\" – another cliche even before being adequately defined – which has somehow become an uber form of editing. </p><p>Carvin's elevation to sacred cow and groundbreaking auteur in the new news media has strongly benefited from the digital establishment's instant and militant defense of its own, and the old media establishment's ambivalence about itself. Indeed, Carvin has what seems like a personal publicist in the technology writer, Matthew Ingram, who often tweets and writes <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2012/05/25/andy-carvin-on-twitter-as-a-newsroom-and-being-human/\">about Carvin's significance</a>, going so far as to say he ought to win a Pulitzer prize for tweeting.
