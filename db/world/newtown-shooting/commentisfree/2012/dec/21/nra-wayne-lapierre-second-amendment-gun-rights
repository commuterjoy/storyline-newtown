I <a href=\"http://www.tomroganthinks.com/2012/12/newtown-and-second-amendment.html\">strongly support the second amendment</a> and I am against new laws that would impose greater, general restrictions on law-abiding gun owners. <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/12/the-case-for-more-guns-and-more-gun-control/309161/?single_page=true#\">Like others on both the right and the left</a>, I believe that the right to bear arms makes a significant, positive contribution to public safety.</p><p>But I also recognize reality. And in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook massacre, it is evident that we need action to better protect the innocent from becoming future victims of gun-related atrocities.</p><p>This understanding isn't just a demand of moral reality; it's also my admission of a rapidly forming new political reality. Americans do not tolerate the murder of innocent children. Children are the core of our communities and our communities are the core of America. As a result, we expect our politicians to act aggressively to protect these most innocent members of our society.</p><p>The American people now wants action. In response to these legitimate demands, LaPierre's answer – the reinforcement of partisanship above all else – offers a course of profound political risk. </p><p>Before the negatives, it's worth noting that LaPierre's speech did have two positives. First, LaPierre made a passionate rebuke to the notion, idealized by some, that all gun owners are evil. They are not. There are &quot;good&quot; gun owners and there are &quot;bad&quot; gun owners. Demagoguery against supporters of the second amendment isn't just an act of extraordinary cultural ignorance, it's also a choice of self-defeating idiocy. Put simply, telling gun owners they are bad citizens doesn't tend to evoke a willingness to respect gun control arguments. </p><p>Second, LaPierre was right to point out the wilful mischaracterization of certain weapons types by some in the media. Honest understanding is a prerequisite for good policy and facts are not negotiable. </p><p>Unfortunately, where LaPierre could have used these rebuttals as steps towards a more productive national debate, he instead employed them as a shield for a wider partisan attack – an attack that will almost certainly damage the gun rights movement in the days ahead.</p><p>Consider these specifics. In his attack on President Obama, LaPierre's speech was not designed to build a foundation for dialogue, but to establish battle-lines. In blaming the media, movies and video games, the speech often appeared desperate and deluded. Is LaPierre seriously advocating the repeal of the first amendment?</p><p>In its constructions around words like &quot;cordon&quot;, &quot;deploy&quot; and a singular obsession with armed security in schools, LaPierre's speech appeared incessantly militaristic and devoid of original thinking. It is a basic truth that American schools are not supposed to be fortresses of security but citadels of learning. The civil rights movement was supposed to have won this battle.</p><p>While there is a place for trained armed volunteers in schools, alone this step is drastically insufficient and must not be framed in an overtly military setting. <a href=\"http://theweek.com/article/index/237951/why-states-should-take-the-lead-in-reforming-gun-laws\">As I argued earlier this week</a>, by improving information sharing, laws and healthcare services, we can more effectively protect our society while also preserving our second amendment rights. But in order to impact this conversation of crucial national concern, gun rights supporters must first be willing to join it. Rhetoric from the partisan sidelines will exclude us from the discourse.</p><p>In addition, if we appear as an obstacle to basic, popular imperatives like the improved protection of children, we will find our appearance is matched by a corresponding collapse of influence. If we want our beliefs respected, we must respect the opinions of others.</p><p>Unfortunately, at the moment at least, it seems that LaPierre simply doesn't get it. Sadly, he isn't alone. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cliff-standoff-boehner-works-to-wrangle-votes-for-plan-b-obama-threatens-veto/2012/12/20/d37cd8c6-4aa5-11e2-9a42-d1ce6d0ed278_story.html?hpid=z1\">As evidenced in the House of Representatives this week</a>, the American conservative movement is facing a terrible conflict of purpose. By viewing free thinking as the irreconcilable enemy of natural reason, by regarding dialogue as the unforgivable betrayal of core values and by labeling political opponents as conspirators and traitors, elements of the conservative base are driving the conservative agenda into a political wasteland. </p><p>If the pursuit of greater isolation is LaPierre's objective, then he should stay firm to the course that he laid out today. On the other hand, if he wants to promote gun rights in America, LaPierre needs to give his approach a major rethink.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401494957|2012-12-22T11:49:02Z|fea05d4b07c2d51b33c6b1bfa5702fa3ba90ab09 -->","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2012-12-21T20:44:01Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","score":"1.0","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/21/1356121210649/NRA-executive-vice-presid-005.jpg","standfirst":"LaPierre's partisan rant did our cause no good: after Sandy Hook, gun rights advocates need to join a constructive dialogue","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3cydv","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/21/1356121210649/NRA-executive-vice-presid-005.jpg","wordcount":"708","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"401494957","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Tom Rogan","publication":"guardian.co.uk","internalPageCode":"1846179","shouldHideAdverts":"true","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-12-24T20:44:01Z"},"tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webTitle":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"world/nra","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"NRA","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nra","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/nra","references":[]},{"id":"world/gun-control","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"US gun control","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/gun-control","references":[]},{"id":"world/us-politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"US politics","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-politics","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"United States","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/newtown-shooting","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Newtown shooting","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newtown-shooting","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/newtown-shooting","references":[]},{"id":"profile/tom-rogan","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Tom Rogan","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tom-rogan","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/tom-rogan","references":[],"bio":"<p>Tom Rogan is an American blogger and writer who recently moved to Washington, DC.
