The group's disconnect from reality is only a function of their hermeneutic arrogance and pathological selfishness. Think about it: the <em>best</em> argument they could bring to the table, after a week of \"respective\" (as LaPierre said) silence, was \"more guns\" – a position undergirded by the belief that the NRA is in a position to <em>help put that policy into place</em>.</p><p>The press conference's opening promised: \"This is the beginning of a serious conversation\" – only to cut off the part of speaking that makes something a conversation: \"We won't be taking any questions.\" Toward the end, LaPierre was even more forceful in cutting off attempts to invade their group fantasy with doubts:</p><blockquote><p>\"There'll be time for talk and debate later.

This is <em>exactly</em> what <em>everyone</em> has turned over in their minds. Sometimes awkwardly, sometimes with not all the facts at hand, often ruled more by heart than head, but if there's a person who saw the news about Sandy Hook and didn't think, \"How can we protect our children right now, starting today?\"</p><p>Well, I would guess those people were in the bunker at the NRA, where the first and only question they have substantively addressed is:</p><blockquote><p>\"How do we protect ourselves?\"</p></blockquote><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401496165|2012-12-22T11:49:02Z|8dd0cfc7eeec4e105f27a53b24fa821b3aef7a22 -->","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2012-12-21T22:07:33Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","score":"1.0","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/4/15/1334459728708/Wayne-LaPierre-003.jpg","standfirst":"The leading gun rights lobbyist gave a performance so tone-deaf that only he missed why 'put more guns in schools' sounds inept","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3cyd9","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/4/15/1334459728708/Wayne-LaPierre-003.jpg","wordcount":"1055","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"401496165","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Ana Marie Cox","publication":"guardian.co.uk","internalPageCode":"1846188","shouldHideAdverts":"true","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-12-24T21:39:00Z"},"tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/series/on-politics-and-whatever","type":"series","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webTitle":"On politics... and whatever","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/series/on-politics-and-whatever","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/series/on-politics-and-whatever","references":[]},{"id":"world/gun-control","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"US gun control","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/gun-control","references":[]},{"id":"world/nra","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"NRA","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nra","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/nra","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"United States","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webTitle":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/newtown-shooting","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Newtown shooting","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newtown-shooting","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/newtown-shooting","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","type":"tone","webTitle":"Comment","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ana-marie-cox","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Ana Marie Cox","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ana-marie-cox","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/ana-marie-cox","references":[],"bio":"<p>Ana Marie Cox is political columnist for the Guardian US.
