It's true, in a sense: when holding objects that are specifically designed to be the most effective killing machines possible, people do, in fact, kill people.</p><p>And yes, people have gone on murderous rampages for all of human history, and have used whatever tools were at their disposal – rocks, knives, swords, their own hands – to inflict violence. The problem comes in when the tools at their disposal are really good at killing others without much work on the part of the killer, which is why lots of folks would like to see the United States institute some reasonable laws regulating gun ownership.</p><p>Time and again, though, the pro-gun right's answer is the same: people will find a way to kill, and violence is inevitable, so taking away guns won't work. Their solution seems to be a society where every citizen has a gun in one hand and crossed fingers on the other. </p><p>That perspective represents not just an intense cultural tie to guns, but a typically conservative view of humanity: people (other than me) are fundamentally bad and our time on Earth is in preparation for the afterlife, so why worry about making it better?</p><p>As we've seen in the debates on issues from climate change to gender equality to foreign policy, facts, statistics and rational arguments don't really matter if the goal of offering them up is to improve things in the here and now. It's a deeply pessimistic view of humanity that projects a strong sense of fatalism.</p><p>The point of being &quot;good&quot; isn't because goodness is valuable unto itself or because goodness is widely beneficial. The point of being good is to earn heaven points. Goodness, then, is defined according to a very particular set of religious and cultural values, and is highly &quot;in-group&quot; focused. Goodness means going to church, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/11/family-isnt-dead\">marrying early, submitting to a husband-in-charge family structure, having children out of obligation</a> and upholding the social pillars that organize society to keep a particular group on top. </p><p>Goodness isn't necessarily helping other people or taking steps that are proven effective at decreasing violence or working to create a more accepting and happy world for our children. Goodness is upholding the power structures that have traditionally benefited the small group of men who think they have a monopoly on defining &quot;goodness.&quot; </p><p>Without strong social incentives and harsh social punishments for deviation from these structures, they collapse – and they collapse because they simply don't serve large swaths of the American population (women who want equal rights, people of color, immigrants, poor people, non-Christians, gay people). There isn't much of a reason for why these particular structures are the best, other than that the few people who benefit from them seem to like them. But the fundamental argument in their favor seems to be that without a social organization that puts white Christian men on top, the hordes of &quot;bad&quot; people will simply be out there – and there is nothing we can do other than arm ourselves against them.</p><p>That's why &quot;guns don't kill people, people kill people&quot; is still considered an actual argument. It's why the debates on gun control go in circles. One side thinks we have serious but fixable cultural problems with violence, with a masculinity that is tied to aggression and with the glorification of gun culture, and that the wide availability of all sorts of deadly weaponry in such a culture enables an unconscionable amount of lethal violence. The other side thinks people are just sinners, our time on this planet is meant to be trying and ugly, guns represent freedom and man's dominion over the Earth, and gun deaths simply result from a <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/335850/conscience-not-guns-dennis-prager\">lack of Christianity</a> and the attendant breaks from a &quot;traditional&quot; model that necessitated the oppression of a great many Americans.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/335850/conscience-not-guns-dennis-prager\">As Dennis Prager argued in the National Review</a>, no one fears being massacred by a &quot;decent&quot; person. We fear being massacred by someone bad.</p><p>It is certainly true that &quot;good&quot; people don't walk into a classroom and shoot a group of six year-olds. It's also true that good people don't murder their wives and girlfriends – yet five times more women are killed by intimate partners every year than by strangers, and 95% of the women who are killed with a firearm are murdered by a man. If there's a gun involved, an incident of domestic violence is 12 times more likely to result in death. And while mass shootings understandably capture our national attention, the more than 30,000 American gun deaths every year (and their <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/19/guns-deaths-sandy-hook-shooting_n_2325706.html?utm_hp_ref=business\">$37bn price tag</a>) should spur us to action. </p><p>It's easy to read those figures and conclude that conservatives are right: we are a world of awful, violent people who are going to keep on being awful and violent no matter what, so gun control serves no purpose and we'll all be better off in Heaven anyway. But as is true with almost anything that makes life on Earth brutish and miserable, we have the power to change that. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/12/14/nine-facts-about-guns-and-mass-shootings-in-the-united-states/\">Gun deaths are lower in the states with the strictest gun control laws</a>. And the majority of US gun deaths actually comprises suicides – acts committed not generally by evil, murderous people, but by individuals who are sick and hurting and need help.</p><p>Many other gun deaths occur in neighborhoods plagued by violence and poverty. What's clear is that while some gun homicides are surely meticulously plotted by an evil-doer who would find a different weapon if no guns were available, the vast majority is lethal specifically <em>because</em> a gun was readily available. </p><p>The solutions, then, must be multifold: poverty alleviation; better mental health care with a focus on suicide prevention and depression treatment, not the stigmatization of the mentally ill, who are more likely to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators; and yes, gun control to make it more difficult for a firearm to be such an easily-accessed weapon. </p><p>To most people who believe in evidence-based policy and sociological realities, those solutions make sense. But to people who have no interest in actually finding solutions or making the world a better, safer, happier place, it's like talking to a brick wall. Why improve life on earth if life on earth is temporary and all that matters is to secure a seat in the clouds? </p><p>That's why you hear people like Mike Huckabee saying that mass shootings are somehow related to <a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/12/17/huckabee-doubles-down-blaming-contraception-now-for-sandy-hook-massacre/\">prayer in school and contraception</a>, or Charlotte Allen arguing that <a href=\"http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2012/12/20/nros-charlotte-allen-blames-the-sandy-hook-massacre-on-a-lack-of-men/\">the decline of traditional gender roles</a> led to these shootings and that husky 12-year-old boys should throw their bodies at armed men. </p><p>Huckabee doesn't actually think that saying prayers prevents gun violence or that contraception makes killers go on shooting sprees, any more than Allen believes that 12-year-old boys are made of Kevlar. They think that the world is divided into sinners and repentant sinners, and the only way to be a &quot;decent&quot; person is to fall in line behind their very narrow, often very harmful, beliefs. </p><p>Gun deaths, of course, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/12/14/nine-facts-about-guns-and-mass-shootings-in-the-united-states/\">are significantly more common in the most religious states of the nation</a>. And gun deaths are very low in the relatively non-religiously-observant states of northern Europe. In the UK, the homicide by firearm rate is approximately <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/12/us-gun-ownership-homicide-rate-higher-than-other-developed-countries/\">one in a million</a>. Ditto in France. That must be nice. More people are killed by guns in the US every day than in an entire year in Japan – by a factor of about 12. </p><p>Every nation in the world has people who are sadistic and violent or sick and violent. And yet, the kinds of regular mass rampages that have now happened several times this year alone in the United States seem to be a specifically American phenomenon.</p><p>As the Sandy Hook shootings unfolded, I watched many of the journalists I follow on Twitter post links to the articles about gun violence that they had written after the previous mass shooting, or the one before that. I watched friends on Facebook like and link to the inevitable memorial pages, this time around noting the too-short lives of 20 smiling kids who were practically infants, ensuring readers and supporters that these little angels are now safely in Heaven.</p><p>That's an impulse I understand, but it's not a solution.</p><p>Only in America do political writers all seem have a stable of articles about mass shootings that they can bring out and repost or revise when the next one occurs. </p><p>Only in America do we collectively shrug our shoulders when yet another young white man goes on a shooting spree. </p><p>Only in America do we remain convinced that people will kill no matter what, so we may as well give people virtually unlimited access to some of the deadliest hand-held weapons ever invented. </p><p>Only here, in America, do we think that the best we can do is a Facebook page and a plea to God.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark:
