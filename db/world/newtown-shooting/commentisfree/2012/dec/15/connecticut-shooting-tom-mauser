We're better than this","headline":"Connecticut shooting: no longer do I ask 'how can this happen again?'","body":"<p>I left a meeting in tears on Friday after reading the news headline on my phone about the tragic school shooting in Connecticut. Yes, it brought back awful memories of my own tragic day at Columbine High School on 20 April, 1999, where my son Daniel was murdered.</p><p>It also reminded me of how many times over the past 13 years that I've said to myself, \"Oh my God, not again!\" after yet another tragic American shooting. No longer, though, do I say, \"How could this happen again?\" There are no surprises, after all, in a nation that goes from tragic shooting to tragic shooting and does virtually nothing in response beyond offering condolences and scratching its collective head.</p><p>Many Americans are still in denial, focusing on the specific pathology of each shooter, using it to explain why gun laws could not have stopped a shooting, and thus avoiding the bigger picture: the question of why America is so awash in gun violence.</p><p>America's mental health system has failed to adequately identify and treat those who are psychologically disturbed and potentially dangerous. Some of these individuals may not even be fully aware of their condition, while some families avoid obtaining treatment because of the cost or because of their antiquated view of the stigma associated with mental illness. Meanwhile, we allow these disturbed individuals easy access to the weapons they crave for mowing down others before they end their own lives.</p><p>America has allowed its gun industry, through the surrogate gun lobby, to write its gun laws. Gun rights activists have offered abundant excuses for gun violence, everything from a lack of school prayer to a \"diverse population\" to the \"Wild West\". Many offer excuses in the form of simplistic cliches and soundbites, such as \"guns don't kill people, people kill people\". These cliches do nothing to solve real problems.</p><p>The only problem cited by the gun lobby is the lack of guns, never their presence or abundance.  Thus, they ask, \"Why didn't the theatre allow people to be armed so they could have shot the killer?\"  or, \"Why didn't we arm the teachers?\" They see no problem with military weapons in the hands of civilians. They argue that we'll only be safer if we more heavily arm ourselves. It's completely lost on them that if having more guns and weak gun laws made America safer, then we should be the safest nation on earth. Clearly we are not.</p><p>Some say there is no easy solution to to America's problem with gun violence. That's true. But in America we can't even have a reasonable conversation about gun violence, let alone suggest solutions, without being told \"this is not the time\" or \"we shouldn't inconvenience law-abiding gun owners with new laws\" or \"you can't do anything to infringe on my Second Amendment right to bear arms\".</p><p>There's a good reason other western nations have not followed America's lead when it comes to gun policy: because they've seen that America's grand experiment with easy access to guns has been a failure. What else would you call over 10,000 gun murders and 70,000 gun injuries per year?</p><p></p><p>I'm sick and tired of America doing nothing.
