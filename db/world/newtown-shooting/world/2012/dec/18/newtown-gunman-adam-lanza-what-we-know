To that effect, detectives have already begun a systematic round of interviews with relatives, friends and neighbours of the Lanza family.</p><p>What we do know is that Lanza was a very intelligent but withdrawn individual who had difficulty associating with others. As yet there has been no confirmation of any mental health diagnosis, and police have indicated he had no criminal track record.</p><p>In 2007, he started at Newtown high school in the middle of the town, the same institution in whose auditorium Barack Obama delivered his impassioned speech on Sunday night. A former director of security at the school, Richard Novia, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324677204578183910797348422.html\">told the Wall Street Journal</a> that Lanza had been assigned a psychologist early on in his time there, not out of fear that he might harm others but out of concern for the teenager.</p><p>&quot;He was very withdrawn and meek; he was one of those freshmen coming in very much in need of watching. At that point in his life, he posed no threat to anyone else. We were worried about him being the victim, or that he could hurt himself,&quot; Novia said.</p><p>Around that time, Adam Diaz, another student at the high school who was in the year above, got to know him. Diaz told CNN that he was &quot;a very intelligent person, he really was, though the way he acted around other people was a little withdrawn.&quot;</p><p>The two teenagers attended the school tech club together where they made videos. &quot;Adam had this typical nerd look: belts, tucked-in shirt. He had a computer case instead of a backpack like everyone, and he even had a pocket protector to keep pens in,&quot; Diaz said.</p><p>&quot;We had a feeling that there might have been something wrong with him, but we never asked.
