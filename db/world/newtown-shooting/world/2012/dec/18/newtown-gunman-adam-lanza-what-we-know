Facts that seemed to offer possible clues to motive have turned out to be false: Adam Lanza, pictured, had never been a student at Sandy Hook elementary, as initially reported, nor had his mother Nancy had anything to do with the school.</p><p>Police investigators are also bumping up against hurdles in their struggle to piece together the shooter's inner world. Lieutenant Paul Vance, the official spokesman for Connecticut state police, has previously said that detectives had found &quot;good evidence&quot; that would help build up a complete picture, though he refused to specify the nature of the material.</p><p>It now transpires that Lanza left no note elucidating why he wanted first to kill his mother and then carry out a mass shooting that left 26 people, including 20 children, dead. Nor did he leave any suicide note.</p><p>Furthermore, before setting out on his killing spree, Lanza appears to have destroyed the hard disc of his home computer, and in so doing probably closed investigators' best window into his intentions. &quot;It looked like he took steps to damage it — he smashed it,&quot; a law enforcement official <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/18/nyregion/security-increased-at-connecticut-schools-as-investigation-into-shooting-continues.html?src=mv&amp;ref=general\">told the New York Times</a>.</p><p>With the main building blocks of any substantial understanding so far lacking, investigators will have to fill in as best they can. To that effect, detectives have already begun a systematic round of interviews with relatives, friends and neighbours of the Lanza family.</p><p>What we do know is that Lanza was a very intelligent but withdrawn individual who had difficulty associating with others. As yet there has been no confirmation of any mental health diagnosis, and police have indicated he had no criminal track record.</p><p>In 2007, he started at Newtown high school in the middle of the town, the same institution in whose auditorium Barack Obama delivered his impassioned speech on Sunday night. A former director of security at the school, Richard Novia, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324677204578183910797348422.html\">told the Wall Street Journal</a> that Lanza had been assigned a psychologist early on in his time there, not out of fear that he might harm others but out of concern for the teenager.</p><p>&quot;He was very withdrawn and meek; he was one of those freshmen coming in very much in need of watching. At that point in his life, he posed no threat to anyone else. We were worried about him being the victim, or that he could hurt himself,&quot; Novia said.</p><p>Around that time, Adam Diaz, another student at the high school who was in the year above, got to know him. Diaz told CNN that he was &quot;a very intelligent person, he really was, though the way he acted around other people was a little withdrawn.&quot;</p><p>The two teenagers attended the school tech club together where they made videos. &quot;Adam had this typical nerd look: belts, tucked-in shirt. He had a computer case instead of a backpack like everyone, and he even had a pocket protector to keep pens in,&quot; Diaz said.</p><p>&quot;We had a feeling that there might have been something wrong with him, but we never asked. We thought it wasn't appropriate to do so.&quot;</p><figure><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/15/1355595816532/Adam-Lanza-perpetrator-of-010.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Lanza, perpetrator of the Sandy Hook school massacre\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Adam Lanza in a photo from 2005.
