Both British investors failed to return requests for comment. Smith &amp; Wesson also declined to comment.</p><p>The power of investors to influence the gun trade was drawn into focus this week when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/dec/18/newtown-shooting-cerberus-sells-stakes\" title=\"\">a Californian teachers' pension fund pressured US private equity firm Cerberus to sell off its stake in Freedom Group</a>, the gun company that made the semi-automatic rifle Lanza used in the shootings.</p><p>Cerberus Capital Management said it was preparing for a sale of its investments in Freedom Group in the wake of the \"unthinkable\" massacre in the town – where the father of the Cerberus founder and chief executive, Stephen Feinberg, lives.</p><p>Cerberus, which manages more than $20bn (£12bn) of investments, said Adam Lanza's killing of 20 children and seven adults was a \"watershed moment\" that raised the debate on gun control to an \"unprecedented level\". Cerberus said it was not the company's role to enter the debate but added: \"There are, however, actions that we as a firm can take.\"</p><p>Freedom said the market for military-type weapons, like the .223 Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle believed to have been used by Lanza, grew by 27% between 2007 and 2011. \"The continued adoption of the modern sporting rifle has led to increased growth in the long gun market, especially with a younger demographic of users and those who like to customise or upgrade their firearms,\" it said.</p><p>The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), the second-biggest pension fund in America, had threatened to withdraw the $751m it had invested in Cerebus unless the private equity fund sold out of the firearms company.</p><p>Californian's treasurer Bill Lockyer said he will propose that CalSTRS and California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) – the two biggest pension funds in the US – sell off all investments in firearms manufacturers that make guns prohibited under state law. California prohibits semi-automatic assault weapons, specifically including the Bushmaster, and magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.</p><p>Will Pomroy, head of corporate governance at the UK's National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF), said: \"It is up to individual funds to determine their investment strategies. However, we would expect funds to actively consider their approach to ethical and social issues as part of determining their strategy. Pension schemes and their advisers have an important role to play in encouraging higher standards of corporate responsibility.\"</p><p>Andre Spicer, a professor at Cass Business School, said investors may be able to achieve more in the gun debate than politicians.</p><p>\"[Cerberus'] move demonstrates again the willingness of shareholders to use their financial muscle to address recent issues,\" he said. \"Some see financial pressure as the next option in the gun control debate, given the difficulty of forcing any meaningful change to gun laws in the US through legislation.\"</p><p>He said investor pressure may be followed by consumer action, that could see Walmart called on to stop selling guns and ammo in its supermarkets.</p><p>\"It is likely that we will see investor activism being followed by consumer pressure. For instance, mass market retailers like Walmart, which is the largest retail of firearms in the US, may come under consumer pressure to drop guns as part of their product mix.</p><p>\"Investor activism coupled with consumer pressure has proved a potent force for changing industries in the past. For instance consumer and investor activism played a large role in changing attitudes to the tobacco industry long before governments created the kind of anti-smoking legislation which is so wide spread today.\"</p><p>• This story was amended on Friday 21 December 2012.

Both British investors failed to return requests for comment. Smith & Wesson also declined to comment.","The power of investors to influence the gun trade was drawn into focus this week when a Californian teachers' pension fund pressured US private equity firm Cerberus to sell off its stake in Freedom Group, the gun company that made the semi-automatic rifle Lanza used in the shootings.","Cerberus Capital Management said it was preparing for a sale of its investments in Freedom Group in the wake of the \"unthinkable\" massacre in the town – where the father of the Cerberus founder and chief executive, Stephen Feinberg, lives.","Cerberus, which manages more than $20bn (£12bn) of investments, said Adam Lanza's killing of 20 children and seven adults was a \"watershed moment\" that raised the debate on gun control to an \"unprecedented level\". Cerberus said it was not the company's role to enter the debate but added: \"There are, however, actions that we as a firm can take.\"","Freedom said the market for military-type weapons, like the .223 Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle believed to have been used by Lanza, grew by 27% between 2007 and 2011. \"The continued adoption of the modern sporting rifle has led to increased growth in the long gun market, especially with a younger demographic of users and those who like to customise or upgrade their firearms,\" it said.","The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), the second-biggest pension fund in America, had threatened to withdraw the $751m it had invested in Cerebus unless the private equity fund sold out of the firearms company.","Californian's treasurer Bill Lockyer said he will propose that CalSTRS and California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) – the two biggest pension funds in the US – sell off all investments in firearms manufacturers that make guns prohibited under state law. California prohibits semi-automatic assault weapons, specifically including the Bushmaster, and magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.","Will Pomroy, head of corporate governance at the UK's National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF), said: \"It is up to individual funds to determine their investment strategies. However, we would expect funds to actively consider their approach to ethical and social issues as part of determining their strategy. Pension schemes and their advisers have an important role to play in encouraging higher standards of corporate responsibility.\"","Andre Spicer, a professor at Cass Business School, said investors may be able to achieve more in the gun debate than politicians.","\"[Cerberus'] move demonstrates again the willingness of shareholders to use their financial muscle to address recent issues,\" he said. \"Some see financial pressure as the next option in the gun control debate, given the difficulty of forcing any meaningful change to gun laws in the US through legislation.\"","He said investor pressure may be followed by consumer action, that could see Walmart called on to stop selling guns and ammo in its supermarkets.","\"It is likely that we will see investor activism being followed by consumer pressure. For instance, mass market retailers like Walmart, which is the largest retail of firearms in the US, may come under consumer pressure to drop guns as part of their product mix.","\"Investor activism coupled with consumer pressure has proved a potent force for changing industries in the past. For instance consumer and investor activism played a large role in changing attitudes to the tobacco industry long before governments created the kind of anti-smoking legislation which is so wide spread today.\"","• This story was amended on Friday 21 December 2012.
