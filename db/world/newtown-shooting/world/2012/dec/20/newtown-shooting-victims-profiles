She knew how to get what she wanted.&quot;</p><p>Charlotte's mother, Joann, bought her a pink dress, her favourite colour, and white boots for the holidays.

Her nine-year-old brother, Guy, was also at Sandy Hook on Friday but wasn't harmed.</p><p>Charlotte also loved being a girl scout, and her mother was her troop leader.</p><p>&quot;There were 10 girls in the group,&quot; Hagen said. &quot;Only five are left.&quot;</p><p><a name=\"Daniel\"></a></p><h2><a name=\"Daniel\">Daniel Barden, 7</a></h2><p></p><p>The family of Daniel Barden, a budding athlete, member of the swim team and soccer player, said he was &quot;fearless in the pursuit of happiness in life&quot; and was a &quot;constant source of joy&quot; in theirs.</p><p>In a statement, Mark and Jackie Barden said their seven-year-old, who was the youngest of three, earned his missing two front teeth and ripped jeans.</p><p>&quot;Words really cannot express what a special boy Daniel was.

He spoke of Chase only in the present tense.</p><p>Another neighbour, Suzanne Baumann, told the Wall Street Journal that Chase was &quot;very receptive to people.

At school, he was &quot;working very hard to advance his reading at first grade&quot;.</p><p>He and his big sister, Anna, were the &quot;best of friends, going to school together, playing games together, and making endless drawings and crafts together&quot; his family said.</p><p>Thoughtful and considerate, he would always welcome guests at the backdoor with &quot;a hug and his contagious smile&quot;.</p><p><a name=\"Grace\"></a></p><h2><a name=\"Grace\">Grace McDonnell, 7</a></h2><p></p><p>On the last day of her life, a smiling Grace Audrey McDonnell skipped to the school bus, waving and blowing her mother kisses goodbye.

She was a mentor to her little sisters, aged three and four, and was teaching them to dance and read.</p><p>Her father, Robbie Parker, one of the first parents to talk publicly about his loss, described the beautiful, blond, always-smiling girl who loved to try new things, except foods.</p><p>&quot;I'm so blessed to be her dad,&quot; he said.

Noah's twin sister and best friend, Arielle, was in a different classroom at the time of the shooting and survived. Together with their eight-year-old sister, Sophia, they were inseparable.</p><p>&quot;They were always playing together, they loved to do things together,&quot; Haller said.</p><p>Haller said his nephew loved to read and liked to figure out how things worked mechanically.

D'Avino was so dedicated she'd make home visits and constantly offered guidance on her son.</p><p>&quot;I'm heartbroken. I'm numb,&quot; Lovetere Stone said. &quot;I think she taught me more about how to be a good mother to a special needs child than anyone else ever had.&quot;</p><h2>Dawn Hochsprung, 47</h2><p>Hochsprung, the principal of Sandy Hook elementary school, mother of two daughters and three stepdaughters, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/15/dawn-hochsprung-sandy-hook-elementary.\">led her school according to her own values of creativity</a>, inclusiveness and academic ambition. </p><p>Her pride in her school and wider community was obvious. She would send memos to parents addressed to the &quot;Sandy Hook family&quot;. She would tweet photos showing glimpses of life there. On the week before the shooting, she tweeted images of fourth-graders rehearsing for their winter concert; before that, the hands of kindergarteners exchanging play money at their makeshift grocery store. The New York Times said she had introduced &quot;Wacky Wednesdays&quot; when students came to school in mismatched clothes.

Relatives, friends and former classmates said she struggled to help Adam cope with a developmental disorder that often left him reserved and withdrawn.</p><h2>Anne Marie Murphy, 52</h2><p>Anne Marie Murphy, a special education teacher at Sandy Hook elementary school, had four children herself. She was a good mother, wife and daughter and was artistic, fun-loving, witty and hard working, her parents, Hugh and Alice McGowan, said.</p><p>She died trying to shield one of her students, Dylan Hockley, six, from the barrage of bullets that would kill them both.

It was going to be her last year, in a job she loved, John Button, a friend of her husband, told the New York Times. When the shots began, Sherlach and the school principal ran towards the shooter and lost their lives in the process.</p><p>Her son-in-law, Eric Schwartz, told the South Jersey Times that Sherlach rooted for the Miami Dolphins, enjoyed trips to the Finger Lakes, and relished helping children overcome their problems. She had planned to leave work early on Friday, he said, but never had the chance. In a news conference, Schwartz said the loss was devastating, but that Sherlach was doing what she loved.</p><p>&quot;Mary felt like she was doing God's work,&quot; he said, &quot;working with the children.&quot;</p><h2>Victoria Soto, 27</h2><p>Victoria Soto, the teacher who died trying to protect her first-graders, has been described as a dedicated educator who had her dream job.</p><p>Her cousin, Jim Wiltsie, a police officer, said the family had been told that Soto, who has been at Sandy Hook for five years, was attempting to get her class into a closet when the gunman entered the room. &quot;In our eyes, she's a hero,&quot; Wiltsie told ABC News.</p><p>&quot;She was trying to shield, getting her children into a closet and protect them from harm. And by doing that put herself between the gunman and the children and that is when she was tragically shot and killed.&quot;</p><p>Wiltsie said the family had taken some comfort in knowing that Soto died while doing a job that she loved.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401418535|2012-12-22T11:49:02Z|bcb04dc0807496a1de07ca3c7c81ab159af6cb29 -->","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2012-12-20T22:05:52Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","score":"1.0","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/16/1355669881910/Teachers-and-pupils-of-Sa-001.jpg","standfirst":"Families and friends of the victims have spoken publicly about their loved ones in the week since the Sandy Hook shootings<br /><br />• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2012/dec/20/newtown-shooting-victims-tribute\">Newtown shootings: the victims remembered</a>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3ckgq","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/16/1355669881910/Teachers-and-pupils-of-Sa-001.jpg","wordcount":"3285","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"401418535","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Karen McVeigh","publication":"guardian.co.uk","internalPageCode":"1845557","shouldHideAdverts":"true","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-12-23T20:34:05Z"},"tags":[{"id":"world/newtown-shooting","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Newtown shooting","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newtown-shooting","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/newtown-shooting","references":[]},{"id":"world/connecticut","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Connecticut","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/connecticut","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/connecticut","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"United States","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"profile/karenmcveigh","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Karen McVeigh","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/karenmcveigh","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/karenmcveigh","references":[],"bio":"<p>Karen McVeigh has been a senior news reporter for the Guardian since December 2006.

persistent, he said.","\"She could carry on a conversation with any adult,\" said Hagen. \"She challenged my sister every day. She knew how to get what she wanted.\"","Charlotte's mother, Joann, bought her a pink dress, her favourite colour, and white boots for the holidays. Every day, the little girl would beg her to let her wear the outfit early. On Friday, the last day of her life, her mother finally relented.","\"This girl was definitely going places,\" her uncle said. Her nine-year-old brother, Guy, was also at Sandy Hook on Friday but wasn't harmed.","Charlotte also loved being a girl scout, and her mother was her troop leader.","\"There were 10 girls in the group,\" Hagen said. \"Only five are left.\"","","","The family of Daniel Barden, a budding athlete, member of the swim team and soccer player, said he was \"fearless in the pursuit of happiness in life\" and was a \"constant source of joy\" in theirs.","In a statement, Mark and Jackie Barden said their seven-year-old, who was the youngest of three, earned his missing two front teeth and ripped jeans.","\"Words really cannot express what a special boy Daniel was. Such a light. Always smiling, unfailingly polite, incredibly affectionate, fair and so thoughtful towards others, imaginative in play, both intelligent and articulate in conversation: in all, a constant source of laughter and joy,\" the family said, in a statement reported by the Wall Street Journal.","The Bardens said their son \"embodied everything that is wholesome and innocent in the world. Our hearts break over losing him and for the many other families suffering loss.\"","","","A photo of Olivia Rose Engel on the \"Friends of the Engel Family Fund\" Facebook page shows her sitting behind the steering wheel of a boat wearing oversized sunglasses, smiling. Another shows her wearing white wings, holding a golden star over her head. She was supposed to be the angel at the Christmas pageant in the St Rose of Lima Church on Saturday, her cousin, John Engel, acting as a spokesman for Olivia's parents, Brian and Shannon, said.","\"She was a beautiful outgoing child\" who took tennis, ballet and hip-hop dance lessons, Engel told television news stations. \"She was not a shy child. She would light up a room with her smile and her sense of humour.\"","He said Olivia was a \"great big sister for Brayden\", her younger brother, who is three, and every night led grace at the family dinner table. Her favourite colours were pink and purple.","Engel said that Olivia's mother was a local teacher, in a family of three generations of teachers.","","","Josephine Grace Gay liked to ride her bike in the street and set up lemonade stands in the summer, according to a neighbour quoted in the Wall Street Journal.","Josephine's obituary said many friends and family described her as a \"gift\". It read: \"She lived seven years, inspiring friends and family with her beautiful smile, loving heart, and playful spirit.\"","In celebration of her joyful and giving spirit, a charitable fund is being set up in her honour.","Images of Dylan beam out from photos his mother, Nicole, has posted on her Twitter page. In one, he is \"Super Dylan\" dressed in a Superman outfit. In another, he poses with his brother Jake, eight. His family, who chose Newtown when they moved from the UK, for the community and the school, said they did not regret their choice. They said the family's happiness had been \"limitless\" in their new home.","He died in the arms of Anne Marie Murphy, an educator who was taking care of his special educational needs.","\"We take great comfort in knowing that Dylan was not alone when he died, but was wrapped in the arms of his amazing aide, Anne Marie Murphy,\" his parents said, in a statement. \"Dylan loved Mrs Murphy so much and pointed at her picture on our refrigerator every day.\"","","","Madeleine's outfits of sunny, floral dresses matched her personality.","\"She was a sweet, unique, bright, sparkling, determined little girl,\" her family said in a statement about her. \"She was an avid reader who loved running and dancing. She was a born leader.\"","Karen Dryer, a neighbour of the Hsu family, described the \"tiny\" little girl she knew as Maddie as a \"very upbeat and kind\" girl who loved bright, flowery dresses. Dryer told the Los Angeles Times that Madeleine and another little girl, Caroline Previdi, who was killed in the tragedy, would reassure her son, Logan, not to be scared when going to school.","","","Catherine Violet Hubbard will be \"remembered for her passion of animals and constant smile\".","Her parents Jennifer and Matthew Hubbard and older brother, Frederick William, asked that all donations in memory of \"our beautiful daughter Catherine Violet\" go to the Newtown animal shelter.","\"Her family prays that she, all the students of Sandy Hook Elementary, and all those affected by this brutal event find peace in their hearts,\" said an obituary in Newstimes.","","","Chase Kowalski was a boy who was always outside, riding his bicycle or playing in the backyard. Last week, he visited his neighbour Kevin Grimes, and told him about completing and winning his first mini-triathlon.","\"You couldn't think of a better child,\" Grimes, a father of five children who all attended Sandy Hook, told the Associated Press.

He lived life with vigour and passion … brave and true.\"","Raised in Sandy Hook with his brother, JT, and a home full of animals, including horses, dogs and a mini-donkey, Jesse was learning to ride horses, according to family friends.","His mother told the newspaper that she was told he had run into the hall to help. \"I can only hope this meant he had less fear and went quickly in his bravery. … It is unbelievable to us that Jesse is now in heaven with Jesus.\"","","","Ana moved to Connecticut with her family just two months before she was killed. Ana's grandmother, Elba Marquez, said they moved from Canada and were drawn in part by the school's stellar reputation.","Marquez had just visited her granddaughter's new home over Thanksgiving. She told the AP: \"It was a beautiful place, just beautiful. What happened does not match up with the place where they live.\"","The grandmother's brother, Jorge Marquez, said the child's nine-year-old brother, Isaiah also was at the school but escaped safely. He confirmed that Ana's father is the Canadian jazz saxophonist, Jimmy Greene, who wrote on Facebook that he was trying to \"work through this nightmare\".","\"As much as she's needed here and missed by her mother, brother and me, Ana beat us all to paradise,\" Greene wrote. \"I love you sweetie girl.\"","","","James, or \"J\", was a \"numbers guy\" who loved math. He would come up with insights beyond his years to explain the relationships between numbers or to work out ways of adding or subtracting them, his obituary said.","He loved the concept of googolplex, which a friend taught him. An energetic little boy, he was always out of bed first, loved being outdoors and swam \"like a fish\" in his grandparents' pool. In an obituary to \"Our Beloved Prince\" his parents, Mark and Cindy, said he loved to wear shorts and T-shirts in any weather. He would use gel to spike his hair, sing at the top of his lungs and ask: \"How old do I have to be to sing on a stage?\". At school, he was \"working very hard to advance his reading at first grade\".","He and his big sister, Anna, were the \"best of friends, going to school together, playing games together, and making endless drawings and crafts together\" his family said.","Thoughtful and considerate, he would always welcome guests at the backdoor with \"a hug and his contagious smile\".","","","On the last day of her life, a smiling Grace Audrey McDonnell skipped to the school bus, waving and blowing her mother kisses goodbye.

Our little hummingbird is starting first grade tomorrow.\"","\"They still call Avielle their California girl,\" Melissa Stewart, a family friend, told the San Diego Union-Tribune. \"When they first moved here, it was hard to keep shoes on Avielle because she was so used to running barefoot on the beach in San Diego.\"","","","Benjamin never walked when he could run, a boy with \"no dimmer switch\", his grandfather said.","Carmen Lobis described him as a kid in overdrive, who was \"exceptional\" and could play the piano beautifully.","\"He always blew us kisses and he would say: 'Catch it and put it in your heart,'\" Lobis told the Denver Post. \"The last time I saw him was two weeks ago when I dropped him off at Sunday school.\"","Lobis said he told the boy's mother, Francine, a music educator, he was going to accomplish many things in his life. \"He was really going to do something special,\" he said.","Allison was a kind-hearted little girl, who loved drawing and would turn her house into an art studio with rows of pictures taped to the walls.","\"She was a sweet, creative, funny, intelligent little girl who had an amazing life ahead of her,\" said her parents, Cheyanne and Ben Wyatt, in her obituary.

She would send memos to parents addressed to the \"Sandy Hook family\". She would tweet photos showing glimpses of life there. On the week before the shooting, she tweeted images of fourth-graders rehearsing for their winter concert; before that, the hands of kindergarteners exchanging play money at their makeshift grocery store. The New York Times said she had introduced \"Wacky Wednesdays\" when students came to school in mismatched clothes.

Relatives, friends and former classmates said she struggled to help Adam cope with a developmental disorder that often left him reserved and withdrawn.","Anne Marie Murphy, a special education teacher at Sandy Hook elementary school, had four children herself. She was a good mother, wife and daughter and was artistic, fun-loving, witty and hard working, her parents, Hugh and Alice McGowan, said.","She died trying to shield one of her students, Dylan Hockley, six, from the barrage of bullets that would kill them both. He died in the arms of the teacher he loved, said Dylan's mother, Nicole. Their bodies were found together, Dylan wrapped in her arms.","Lauren Gabrielle Rousseau had wanted to be a teacher from the age of three.

It was going to be her last year, in a job she loved, John Button, a friend of her husband, told the New York Times. When the shots began, Sherlach and the school principal ran towards the shooter and lost their lives in the process.","Her son-in-law, Eric Schwartz, told the South Jersey Times that Sherlach rooted for the Miami Dolphins, enjoyed trips to the Finger Lakes, and relished helping children overcome their problems. She had planned to leave work early on Friday, he said, but never had the chance.

And by doing that put herself between the gunman and the children and that is when she was tragically shot and killed.\"","Wiltsie said the family had taken some comfort in knowing that Soto died while doing a job that she loved."]}
