He said that the NRA would produce a plan to create &quot;security shields&quot; around every single school in the country, with armed guards at the entrance.</p><p>&quot;The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,&quot; LaPierre said. He said that if Adam Lanza, the Newtown gunman, had been confronted by a qualified armed security guard as he began blasting his way into Sandy Hook elementary school last Friday, &quot;isn't it at least possible that 26 little kids might have been spared that day&quot;.</p><p>In fact, 20 children died in Sandy Hook school, along with six staff members.</p><p>LaPierre delivered his comments at a press conference in Washington a week almost to the hour after the Newtown massacre took place. In the wake of the shooting, there have been mounting calls for moves to control guns including a ban on military-style assault weapons, a cap on high-capacity magazine and tightened background checks on private gun sellers.</p><p>The NRA chief made no mention of any of those issues, other than to accuse the US media of &quot;misinformation and dishonesty&quot; in its portrayal of gun ownership in the country. His only mention of President Barack Obama, who has called for national action to combat the carnage of mass shootings, was to charge him with removing a federal budget for a &quot;secure our schools&quot; policing programme.</p><p>As he spoke, the NRA's executive vice-president was interrupted twice by protesters carrying banners that said &quot;NRA: Killing Our Kids&quot; and &quot;NRA: Blood On Its Hands&quot;.</p><video controls=\"controls\" class=\"gu-video\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/12/21/122112nraprotest-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/12/21/122112nraprotest-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/12/21/122112nraprotest_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/122112nraprotest/122112nraprotest.m3u8\"></source> </video><p>The White House maintained a minute's silence for Newtown that fell coincidentally, or perhaps intentionally, while LaPierre was speaking.
