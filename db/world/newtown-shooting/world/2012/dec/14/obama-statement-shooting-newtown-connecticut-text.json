They had their entire lives ahead of them – birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers – men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. </p><p>So our hearts are broken today – for the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children, and for the families of the adults who were lost. Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors as well, for as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight, they know that their children's innocence has been torn away from them too early, and there are no words that will ease their pain. </p><p>As a country, we have been through this too many times. Whether it's an elementary school in Newtown, or a shopping mall in Oregon, or a temple in Wisconsin, or a movie theater in Aurora, or a street corner in Chicago – these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children. And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics.</p><p>This evening, Michelle and I will do what I know every parent in America will do, which is hug our children a little tighter and we'll tell them that we love them, and we'll remind each other how deeply we love one another. But there are families in Connecticut who cannot do that tonight. And they need all of us right now. In the hard days to come, that community needs us to be at our best as Americans. And I will do everything in my power as President to help.</p><p>Because while nothing can fill the space of a lost child or loved one, all of us can extend a hand to those in need – to remind them that we are there for them, that we are praying for them, that the love they felt for those they lost endures not just in their memories but also in ours.</p><p>May God bless the memory of the victims and, in the words of Scripture, heal the brokenhearted and bind up their wounds.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401107582|2012-12-22T11:49:05Z|ad13bb36c87633b122f119682136fdd6c254ba6f -->","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2012-12-14T21:14:32Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","score":"1.0","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/14/1355518864952/Barack-Obama-newtown-003.jpg","standfirst":"Visibly moved while delivering remarks at the White House, president calls for US flags to be lowered to half-staff","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3ch4t","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/14/1355518864952/Barack-Obama-newtown-003.jpg","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"401107582","isPremoderated":"false","publication":"guardian.co.uk","internalPageCode":"1843038","shouldHideAdverts":"true","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-12-17T21:08:08Z"},"tags":[{"id":"world/newtown-shooting","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Newtown shooting","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newtown-shooting","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/newtown-shooting","references":[]},{"id":"world/gun-crime","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Gun crime","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-crime","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/gun-crime","references":[]},{"id":"world/gun-control","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"US gun control","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/gun-control","references":[]},{"id":"world/barack-obama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Barack Obama","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/barack-obama","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"United States","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","type":"tone","webTitle":"News","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/articles","references":[]}],"factboxes":[],"mediaAssets":[],"references":[]},"entities":[{"text":"FBI","frequency":1,"entity":"Organisation"},{"text":"Americans","frequency":1,"entity":"Misc"},{"text":"Mueller","frequency":1,"entity":"Person"},{"text":"White House","frequency":2,"entity":"Location"},{"text":"Scripture","frequency":1,"entity":"Misc"},{"text":"US","frequency":2,"entity":"Location"},{"text":"Oregon","frequency":1,"entity":"Location"},{"text":"Newtown","frequency":2,"entity":"Location"},{"text":"Wisconsin","frequency":1,"entity":"Location"},{"text":"Aurora","frequency":1,"entity":"Location"},{"text":"Connecticut","frequency":1,"entity":"Location"},{"text":"Chicago","frequency":1,"entity":"Location"},{"text":"Michelle","frequency":1,"entity":"Person"},{"text":"America","frequency":2,"entity":"Location"},{"text":"Obama","frequency":1,"entity":"Person"},{"text":"Malloy","frequency":2,"entity":"Person"}],"sentances":["Visibly moved while delivering remarks at the White House, president calls for US flags to be lowered to half-staff","This afternoon, I spoke with Governor Malloy and FBI Director Mueller.
