He was described by a relative as a &quot;really lively, smart kid&quot; whose family had moved to Connecticut from Brooklyn for the quality and security of its schools.</p><p>White balloons lined the street outside the funeral home where the ceremony for Noah took place. The balloons bobbed around in the light breeze as dozens waited patiently to enter the building and pay their respects.</p><p>&quot;Our hearts are with you Noah,&quot; said a green sign pinned to a tree outside the Abraham L Green &amp; Son funeral home. Flowers and a brown teddy bear had been placed at the base of the tree.</p><p>Amoung the mourners was his twin sister. She had been at the school on Friday morning, but was in a different classroom and survived.</p><p>Rabbi Shaul Praver, who was leading the funeral in Fairfield, a town 25 miles away from Newtown, said he had spoken to the mother of the boy and counselled her on the hard road ahead. &quot;I told the mother not to plan the rest of her life out right now because she says: 'What am I going to do without my baby?'&quot;</p><p>Guests walked slowly into the wood-panelled funeral home at around 12.30pm, some wearing blue ribbons in their lapels with cut off angels in the centre that have become the symbol of the Sandy Hook school tragedy. The street, which runs away from one of the main roads through Fairfield towards the shore, was blocked off to the public as the Pozner family prepared to bid Noah farewell in private.</p><p>Outside the home Rabbi Yakov Barros said people at the funeral were from &quot;all walks of life&quot;. He did not know the Pozner family but had travelled from the Catskills in New York, where he is involved with the South Fallsburg Hebrew Association.</p><p>&quot;I'm here as a human being offering my love and support,&quot; Barros said. He said that the Pozner family had felt &quot;tremendous warmth&quot; that he had travelled to be at the funeral. &quot;The mother was very touched. She was crying at the fact I came.&quot;</p><p>Just before 2pm people began to slowly file out of the funeral home where Noah Pozner's funeral took place. The door to the black hearse opened, and was closed. Police motorcycles led the procession away.</p><p>Roxanne Dunn, who taught Noah and his twin sister karate, said their mother had given a &quot;beautiful&quot; speech, telling the mourners that her son &quot;would always be a part of her. He'll always be part of our lives.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It touched us all,&quot; said Dunn, wiping away tears. </p><p>&quot;He was a beautiful child. A beautiful family. A really, really good family,&quot; she said, adding that during karate lessons Noah and his sister had &quot;never wanted to be put on different teams, they always wanted to be on the same team&quot;.</p><p>Audrey Petschek, 48, has lived close to Sandy Hook school for over 20 years. &quot;I just think its important that everybody in Newtown is there to support the families,&quot; she said.</p><p>She said it had been a &quot;very personal and loving tribute&quot;.</p><p>Pozner's elder brother had spoken at the funeral, Petschek said. &quot;Just how he had an endless love for his brother. He's very strong right now. He's being remarkably strong.&quot;</p><p>Pozner's mother spoke too. &quot;She's obviously numb too,&quot; Petschek said. &quot;But, you know, a mother's love â€¦ It was hard to hear.&quot;</p><p>The second funeral was for Jack Pinto, also six, whose main passion had been the New York Giants American football team. In photos, he was shown with an NY logo drawn on his face and &quot;Go Giants!&quot; tattooed in crayon on his hand.

The venue was a white clapperboard building in the classic New England style that seemed almost too elegant and refined in the circumstances, considering the horror that had brought the people here.</p><p>Outside about 20 of the boy's friends, some wearing sweat shirts of the<br />Newtown Youth Wrestling Association which he had joined just a year ago, milled around on the lawn.

As a way of making manifest the grief, of memorialising it, residents and visitors have set up makeshift shrines that grow larger with every day.</p><p>Sandy Hook fire house, where 20 sets of parents learned that their children would not be coming home, has become the main site of mourning.
