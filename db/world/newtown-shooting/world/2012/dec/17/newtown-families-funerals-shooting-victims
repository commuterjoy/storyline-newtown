He was described by a relative as a &quot;really lively, smart kid&quot; whose family had moved to Connecticut from Brooklyn for the quality and security of its schools. &quot;That's one of the reasons they moved: for safety and education,&quot; the boy's uncle, Arthur Pozner, told Newsday.</p><p>Rabbi Shaul Praver, who was leading the funeral in Fairfield, a town 25 miles away from Newtown, said he had spoken to the mother of the boy, whose twin sister was also at Sandy Hook elementary but survived. &quot;I told the mother not to plan the rest of her life out right now because she says, 'What am I going to do without my baby?&quot;</p><p>The second funeral was for Jack Pinto, also six, whose main passion had been the New York Giants American football team. In photos, he was shown with an NY logo drawn on his face and &quot;Go Giants!&quot; tattooed in crayon on his hand. His favourite player was the receiver Victor Cruz, who played against the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday with &quot;Jack Pinto, My Hero&quot; written on his boots.</p><p>As the town of about 25,000 people braces itself for so many funerals – of the 20 children, the six teachers and teaching assistants, as well as those of the shooter Adam Lanza and his mother, Nancy, whom he killed before setting off for the school – residents and visitors have been setting up makeshift memorials as a focus for communal grief.</p><p>Sandy Hook fire house, where 20 sets of parents learned that their children would not be coming home, has become the main site of mourning. People drift to and from the growing memorial, some leaving flowers, others soft toys. Many just stand in silence.</p><p>There is a Christmas tree for each victim, and a space in the middle of the festive shrubbery is filled with flowers, balloons and toys. Two awnings have been erected to shield the tributes and protect the hundreds of candles glowing against the damp greyness of the New England day.</p><p>The decorations in the trees reflect the age of most of the victims. Teddy bears peer out from between the branches; toy rabbits and pigs have been placed at the base of other trees. Two Teletubbies sit in adjacent trees; a Kung Fu Panda balances precariously in another.</p><p>Anika Tarne, 18, was reading some of the messages left by wellwishers. She moved to Newtown five months ago, from Hannover in Germany. &quot;I just can't believe it's happened here,&quot; she said. Tarne is working as an au pair in Newtown during her gap year. &quot;My au pair son is seven, but is at a different primary school.&quot;</p><p>Her parents had called her after the shooting on Friday. &quot;They were shocked and afraid,&quot; Tarne said. &quot;They just cried, and then they were totally afraid that something could happen to me.&quot;</p><p>The road down to the center of Sandy Hook is adorned with tributes to those killed. Many of the houses have erected banners asking for prayers or expressing hope. On the lawn of one home, 20 wooden angels have been placed, the two-foot high structures each with flowers and teddy bears at their feet.</p><p>As schools across Connecticut reopened on Monday morning, there were signs of nervousness in the wake of Friday's terrible events. Schools in two towns close to Newtown were in lockdown after reports of suspicious individuals who may or may not have been armed.</p><p>Police in Ridgefield, about 20 miles from the site of Friday's rampage, said they were looking &quot;for a suspicious person at an elementary school&quot;. All schools were also in emergency procedures in Redding, about 10 miles from Newtown.</p><p>Local police across the state were providing extra patrols outside schools, and messages have been sent from senior officers outlining safety plans in place. The education commissioner in Connecticut, Stefan Pryor, was sending a letter to all school boards in the state advising classroom teachers how to talk about the tragedy in Newtown with children.</p><p>&quot;In many instances, teachers will want to discuss the events because they are so recent and so significant, but they won't necessarily know how to go about it,&quot; Pryor said.</p><p>In Newtown, all schools but one will reopen on Tuesday. Parents said they were apprehensive about the immediate future. &quot;I feel like we have to get back to normal, but I don't know if there is normal any more,&quot; said Kim Camputo, a mother of two children aged five and 10. &quot;I'll definitely be dropping them off and picking them up myself for a while.&quot;</p><p>The one school that will remain closed – possibly for ever – is Sandy Hook elementary. Plans are being drawn up to send the children to temporary classes in an adjacent town.</p><p>Plans for the longer term remain unclear for the almost 700 survivors of the school shooting. Lieutenant George Sinko of Newtown police said he would &quot;find it very difficult&quot; for the children to return to Sandy Hook, but stressed: &quot;We want to keep these kids together. They need to support each other.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401222418|2012-12-22T11:49:03Z|69826b652933715e4cb481b485592266e5fd33e1 -->","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2012-12-18T14:11:25Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","score":"1.0","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/12/17/1355763008055/A-memorial-in-Newtown-Con-005.jpg","standfirst":"Services for Noah Pozner and Jack Pinto take place on Monday as residents set up makeshift memorials as focus for grief","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3ct3n","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/12/17/1355763008055/A-memorial-in-Newtown-Con-005.jpg","wordcount":"895","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"401222418","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Adam Gabbatt and Ed Pilkington in Newtown","publication":"guardian.co.uk","internalPageCode":"1843745","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-12-20T17:09:03Z"},"tags":[{"id":"world/newtown-shooting","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Newtown shooting","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newtown-shooting","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/newtown-shooting","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"United States","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/connecticut","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Connecticut","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/connecticut","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/connecticut","references":[]},{"id":"world/gun-crime","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Gun crime","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-crime","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/gun-crime","references":[]},{"id":"world/us-crime","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"US crime","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-crime","references":[]},{"id":"world/gun-control","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"US gun control","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/gun-control","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","type":"tone","webTitle":"News","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/edpilkington","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Ed Pilkington","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/edpilkington","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/edpilkington","references":[],"bio":"<p>Ed Pilkington is the chief reporter for Guardian US.
