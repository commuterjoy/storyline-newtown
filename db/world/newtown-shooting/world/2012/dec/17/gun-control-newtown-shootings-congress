Support for greater restrictions attracts the opposition of the powerful pro-gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, without winning many votes.</p><p>After the horror of Newtown, the issue is back on the agenda with more powerful voices calling for reform, from New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, to leading senators. Among them is Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia and NRA member, who said on Monday it was time to \"move beyond rhetoric\" and discuss new gun controls.</p><p>\"I don't know anyone in the sporting or hunting arena that goes out with an assault rifle,\" he said on MSNBC. \"I don't know anyone that needs 30 rounds in a clip to go hunting.

The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, named after the White House press secretary wounded in an assassination attempt against President Ronald Reagan in 1981, countered that the ban led to a significant drop in the number of such guns used in crime, although they were always only a fraction of the total.</p><p>But crime statistics aside, an attempt to renew the ban is likely to face entrenched resistance from the NRA and many gun owners that could scare off congressional support.</p><p>After Congress passed the original restrictions on semi-automatics in 1994, Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives for the first time in nearly 40 years. The issue helped mobilise the gun lobby, as opposition coalesced around the idea that the ban was the first step toward taking away guns from Americans.</p><p>An NRA campaign helped oust members of Congress who supported the ban, including the Democratic speaker, Tom Foley. Clinton acknowledged in his autobiography that his gun control legislation damaged the Democrats at the ballot box.</p><p>\"The NRA had a great night. They beat both Speaker Tom Foley and Jack Brooks, two of the ablest members of Congress, who had warned me this would happen.

When the ban on semi-automatics came up for a renewal a decade later, many politicians concluded there was little to be gained and a lot to lose in crossing the NRA. The renewal was blocked in the Senate.</p><p>Since then, a Congresswoman from New York, Carolyn McCarthy, whose husband was among six people shot dead by a gunman on a train in 1993, has repeatedly introduced bills to renew the ban.

The NRA, through its Political Victory Fund, spent almost $12m in a failed attempt to stop Obama's re-election, <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/outside-spending/committee/national-rifle-association-of-america-political-victory-fund/C00053553\">according to Sunlight</a>, which also found that across all the races the fund invested in, the NRA enjoyed a return rate of just 0.83%.</p><p>Some members of Congress have suggested the pro-gun lobby is able to mobilise far fewer votes than it claims, and that its influence lies in its ability to intimidate, not least by threatening to throw millions into congressional races to support or oppose individual candidates.</p><p>\"I believe the NRA has as much sway on Capitol Hill as any lobbying group in the country,\" Mike Castle, a former Republican congressman, told National Public Radio. \"They've done a very effective job of convincing people that, whether it's true or not … they have the power to completely limit their futures in elected office if they don't co-operate.\"</p><p>Few dispute, though, that however the NRA exercises its influence, it is considerable.
