The road is blocked off by police, with a huddle of TV reporters filing occasional pieces to camera from behind a yellow police line.

She catches the school bus with other children from the neighbourhood to Sandy Hook elementary. She was at school Adam Lanza burst into the building and started firing.</p><p>&quot;I was scared because I didn't really know what was going on,&quot; she said, holding her sister Annie's hand as she spoke on the grass outside her home. </p><p>The fourth-grader was in gym class when she and her classmates heard gunshots. &quot;There was a loud banging noise, you heard it twice,&quot; she said. The noise came over the loudspeaker system installed in the school. Elise, whose mother gave permission for her to be interviewed, did not immediately identify the noise as gunfire. &quot;At first it was more of like a loud noise. In the office you could hear over the intercom, you could hear the principal yelling,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;I think she might have been hurt. It sounded like she was yelling because she was hurt.&quot;</p><p>Elise's teacher rounded up the class and they hid together in a corner of the gym, she said, before piling into a storage closet. They huddled there until police arrived.</p><p>&quot;I was just hoping that nothing would happen to anyone,&quot; she said. From the hiding place the children were aware of the gunman walking through the school.</p><p>&quot;When he was in the hallways you didn't know, he could come in here or he could not come in here, and it was really scary because you didn't know where he was or what he was doing.&quot;</p><p>Elise said she could hear gunshots &quot;and you could hear him running around&quot;. </p><p>Her older sister Annie, 16, said the family had attended the Sandy Hook elementary school's Christmas concert on Thursday, the night before the shooting.</p><p>&quot;The principal actually was just really great that night, we were taking notice of that, and I was just hugging my old teachers that I still talk to,&quot; Annie Beier said. Sandy Hook's principal, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/15/dawn-hochsprung-sandy-hook-elementary\">Dawn Hochsprung, 47,</a> was among those killed.</p><p>Elise Beier said she liked going to her school. &quot;Everybody's really nice and the lessons, they kind of make it so it's more of a game than a lesson.&quot;</p><p>She said the friends from her class, who hid together in the gym, were all OK. &quot;But I knew a couple of kids from my bus, that ...,&quot; she said, her voice trailing off.</p><p>Elise's class and teacher made it out of their hiding place when police arrived and secured the building. The 10-year-old was reunited with her mother and siblings at the fire house close to the school.</p><p>&quot;I was really happy because I missed them and you need someone to comfort you because it's scary. You're scared.&quot;</p><p>Back in the centre of Sandy Hook, St John's Episcopal church staged a special service on Saturday afternoon. The small church is just 200m from the elementary school, separated by the woodland that covers much of the greenspace in and around the town.</p><p>St John's had opened early on Friday after news of the shooting emerged. Volunteers said they planned to keep the church open 24 hours a day for now.</p><p>&quot;Prayer is the answer. We need to pray for the community,&quot; said Lee Paulsen, speaking after the service. Around 40 people had squeezed into the small greystone church to pray and comfort one another.</p><p>Paulsen said she worked at Sandy Hook elementary &quot;years ago&quot; – she could not recall the exact date she stopped – as a one-on-one educator.</p><p>&quot;They're just a caring bunch of people,&quot; she said of the school community. &quot;They're just very very caring and loving. It's a beautiful school.&quot;</p><p>Sandy Hook has been Paulsen's home for 40 years. She said it was difficult to comprehend Friday's events. &quot;There's no words to say. I don't believe it's happened,&quot; she said. &quot;They're just babies.&quot;</p><p>Hundreds of reporters have descended on this small town and the eagerness of photographers and film crews to get the best footage caused tensions at points during the service.</p><p>A group of photographers and TV camera crew was ushered out of the church after crowding round a group of churchgoers while they knelt and prayed. One minister at the church had to repeatedly step in front of cameras to deter some of the crews from attempting to record footage.</p><p>Outside, Mary Fellows, 49, a film set designer, wept as she spoke of what had happened. &quot;My friends with kids at the school, they just said they don't know how they're going to get them to not be afraid of it,&quot; she said. Fellows set up a farmers' market in Sandy Hook in 2003 and described a friendly community where many people know each other.</p><p>&quot;Even if you don't know their names you totally know their faces,&quot; she said. &quot;Everybody has been calling everyone they know [to check up on one another].&quot;</p><p>Lanza travelled to the school with three guns, although the Connecticut medical examiner said on Saturday that the deaths were all from injuries caused by an assault rifle. Fellows, whose daughter Cleo Conk, 16, did her elementary school at Sandy Hook, called for stricter controls on firearms.</p><p>&quot;A blanket ban on guns [or] maybe just make the bullets harder to get. I don't know. I don't see why everyone has to have one.&quot;</p><p>Close to the church a group of youngsters had set up a table outside a cafe and were collecting donations for those affected. Daniel Quinn, 22, said the group of around 10 people were all friends from high school who had just returned from college for Christmas.</p><p>Quinn was in his room at James Madison University, Virginia, when he received a text from a friend saying Sandy Hook was on television. &quot;Seeing your own hometown on national news is something you'd never expect,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn't believe it.&quot;</p><p>He and his friends set up three donation points around the community. Within three hours they collected over $1,000, which they planned to give to church officials who would pass it on to families.</p><p>&quot;People are being really generous,&quot; Quinn said. &quot;We just had to do something.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401151785|2012-12-22T11:49:04Z|09df5471339403390e6ede532eafbcbe9309dd9b -->","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2012-12-16T02:50:25Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","score":"1.0","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/12/16/1355625730438/A-sign-of-support-posted--003.jpg","standfirst":"Festive atmosphere replaced by one of mourning but tributes and fundraising show a town rallying round those in pain<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/15/newtown-shooting-victims-full-list\">• Read the full list of victims</a>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3chac","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/12/16/1355625730438/A-sign-of-support-posted--003.jpg","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"401151785","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Adam Gabbatt in Newtown","publication":"guardian.co.uk","internalPageCode":"1843194","shouldHideAdverts":"true","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-12-19T02:50:25Z"},"tags":[{"id":"world/newtown-shooting","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Newtown shooting","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newtown-shooting","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/newtown-shooting","references":[]},{"id":"profile/adam-gabbatt","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Adam Gabbatt","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/adam-gabbatt","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/adam-gabbatt","references":[],"bio":"<p>Adam Gabbatt is a reporter and live blogger for the Guardian, based in New York.
