And because this time, we're really poised to harness that outrage and create a focused and sustained outcry for change.\"</p><p>Obama received an early suggestion that the mood on guns may have shifted from the widespread derision that greeted the statement by the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, when he said immediately after the Newtown massacre that it was not the day to discuss gun control. </p><p>That prompted questions on social media as to whether George Bush would have said that September 11, 2001 was not the day to discuss terrorism or the sinking of the Titanic was not the day to discuss shortages of lifeboats.</p><p>A campaign for greater controls, <a href=\"http://www.demandaplan.org/newtown\">Demand a Plan to End Gun Violence</a>, said in response to Carney that after the Newtown killings \"condolences are not enough\".</p><p>\"Mass shootings and gun murders have become commonplace in our country because our laws are broken and our leaders have no plan to address gun violence. Hours after the shooting, White House press secretary Jay Carney said: 'Today is not the day … to engage in the usual Washington policy debates. I think that that day will come, but today is not that day.' We couldn't disagree more,\" it said</p><p>\"We say, Now IS the Time to talk about guns. Now IS the time to prevent more pointless deaths.\"</p><p>Robert Spitzer, author of the Politics of Gun Control and chair of the political science department at State University of New York College at Cortland, said the moment might be right for a tightening of gun laws.</p><p>\"It holds up the prospect that it might precisely because this shooting was uniquely horrifying to the public,\" he said. \"People have been really shocked in a way they have not been in recent times and that creates a political environment that can shake the country out of its paralysis or torpor on this issue. When there's been movement on the gun issue in the past it's often been in response to unusually shocking shootings or similar events.</p><p>\"The other thing is this political moment in time – Obama's just come off a convincing re-election win. His party picked up some seats in both houses of Congress. The new Congress will be coming in in just a few weeks. And that provides really an ideal moment for advancing a new policy idea if there's a desire and a will to do it.\"</p><p>However, in trying to force through new legislation the president will have to reassure members of Congress afraid of crossing the NRA because of its power to mobilise voters on the gun issue.</p><p>Opinion polls over recent years have shown a shift away from public support for tighter gun controls. A Pew opinion poll after last year's shootings in Arizona involving Giffords found that 49% of Americans said it was \"more important to protect the rights of Americans to own guns\" compared to the 46% who said it was \"more important to control gun ownership\".</p><p>Spitzer said that is because the voices of gun rights advocates are mostly all that is heard in politics and the media.</p><p>\"There has been declining support, to a great degree because no one has been making the case for gun control in systematic way in about the last 10 years. The Bush administration was very much in the gun rights camp and Democrats and many other gun control spokespeople have been somewhat cowed and more muted in their comments on the issue. The Democrats have run away from the issue in the last few years,\" he said. </p><p>\"But when you look at polls on specific issues it's different. When you ask the public do they think large capacity bullet magazines should not be made available, most people agree with that. Most people agree that the mentally ill should not have ready access to guns. That's one thing that united most of these mass shootings – they are by people with demonstrable mental illness problems.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401174029|2012-12-22T11:49:04Z|498cd7c485729aed1af1d082466455723a38b96f -->","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2012-12-16T21:29:29Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","score":"1.0","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/16/1355691726844/Obama-on-the-way-to-Newto-003.jpg","standfirst":"The president's pattern of inaction on gun control has riled critics for years – but will Newtown change any of that?","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3chg4","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/16/1355691726844/Obama-on-the-way-to-Newto-003.jpg","wordcount":"1252","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"401174029","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Chris McGreal","publication":"guardian.co.uk","internalPageCode":"1843348","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-12-19T21:29:29Z"},"tags":[{"id":"world/gun-control","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"US gun control","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/gun-control","references":[]},{"id":"world/barack-obama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Barack Obama","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/barack-obama","references":[]},{"id":"world/newtown-shooting","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Newtown shooting","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newtown-shooting","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/newtown-shooting","references":[]},{"id":"world/gun-crime","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Gun crime","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-crime","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/gun-crime","references":[]},{"id":"world/obama-administration","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Obama administration","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/obama-administration","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/obama-administration","references":[]},{"id":"world/nra","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"NRA","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nra","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/nra","references":[]},{"id":"world/congress","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"US Congress","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congress","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/congress","references":[]},{"id":"world/us-politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"US politics","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-politics","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"United States","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"profile/chrismcgreal","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Chris McGreal","webUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/chrismcgreal","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/chrismcgreal","references":[],"bio":"<p>Chris McGreal is the Guardian's Washington correspondent.
