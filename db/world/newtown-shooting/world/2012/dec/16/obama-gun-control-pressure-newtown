That's is roughly the number of Americans killed during the whole Vietnam war,\" said Bloomberg, on NBC's Meet the Press.</p><p>The mayor called for a renewal of the assault weapons ban that president Bill Clinton pushed through Congress in 1994, which also included restrictions on the size of bullet magazines.

I intend to talk about it on the floor of the United States Senate perhaps as early as this week.\" </p><p>The debate has also widened to include questions about treatment of the mentally ill, another factor common to most recent mass killings in America.

numbers of bullets.</p><p>The president was also silent when the supreme court struck down state and local restrictions on gun ownership, and when some southern states passed laws permitting guns in bars and churches.</p><p>The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, named after James Brady, the former White House press secretary who was badly wounded during an assassination attempt against President Ronald Reagan, <a href=\"http://www.bradycenter.org/reports/obamareport\">gave Obama an \"F\" grade on gun control</a>.</p><p>In a report on the president's gun policy after a year in
