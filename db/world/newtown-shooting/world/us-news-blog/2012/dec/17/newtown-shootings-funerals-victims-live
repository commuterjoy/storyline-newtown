Any new bill would need the forceful support of the president and of powerful figures outside Washington such as New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the head of Mayors Against Illegal Guns.</p><p>But laws are passed by Congress, and without Congress, even an impassioned president cannot turn the pleas of a nation for public safety into a real barrier to unhinged people obtaining weapons made to kill humans.</p><p>Blake names Democrats in Congress who can help, including California Senator Dianne Feinstein, who &quot;said Sunday that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/12/16/feinstein-will-introduce-assault-weapons-ban-in-senate/\">she will introduce a bill that would reinstate the assault weapons ban</a>, a law that lapsed in 2004 and hasn’t even made it to the floor of the Senate for renewal.&quot;</p><p>For any new gun legislation to become a reality, however, certain politicians will have to go against their perceived narrow political interests. These politicians generally fall into two groups: Republicans and Democrats living in &quot;red&quot; states.</p><p>Here are the Democrats Blake names:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p><strong>&nbsp;Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.)</strong>: While it will be hard for any gun control bill to get GOP votes, it will also be very difficult to get votes from Senate Democrats who face reelection in red states in 2014. And they are legion. Sens. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), Mary Landrieu (D-La.), Mark Pryor (D-Ark.), Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) and Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) are all up in two years and will be very tough votes to get.&nbsp;And that doesn’t include Democratic senators in pro-gun swing states like Mark Udall in Colorado and Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire. In fact, Reid himself comes from a pro-gun state, and his supporters&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/08/27/for-reid-no-nra-endorsement/\">actively sought the NRA’s endorsement</a>&nbsp;in his 2010 reelection bid. If those red state Democrats vote for a bill, it will be in large part because of Reid’s leadership and because he took the leap with them.</p></blockquote><p>Read the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/12/17/the-6-most-important-people-in-the-looming-gun-control-debate/\">full piece here</a>.</p></div><p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-12-17T17:23:06.700Z\">at 12.23pm ET</time></p></div><div id=\"block-50cf4f7eb5799fbf77759f4d\" class=\"block\"><p class=\"block-time published-time\"><time datetime=\"2012-12-17T16:59:42.808Z\">11.59am <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time></p><div class=\"block-elements\"><p><strong>The victims:</strong> Class photos and other pictures&nbsp;of some of the victims, including children, with short biographical notes <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gallery/2012/dec/16/sandy-hook-shooting-victims-pictures#/?picture=401158467&amp;index=0\">are here</a>.

Wake services for a third victim are planned for this evening. The town of Newtown will hold funerals for the next three days. Here's a summary of where things stand:","• New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg began a new push for gun control legislation with a press conference attended by dozens of family members of victims of gun violence. The mayor introduced a series of videos known as Demand A Plan, in which people talk about losing loved ones to gun violence and call for new laws. ","• Governor Dan Malloy called for tougher federal gun laws including a ban on assault weapons and large ammunition clips. The discussion of how politicians might pass new gun laws gained momentum.","• Connecticut state police said the investigation would be exhaustive and take some time. The governor ordered that a vacant schoolhouse near Newtown be opened to take Sandy Hook students. The governor called for a statewide minute of silence for the victims on Friday morning.","5.51pm ET","Over the weekend Fox News producers and hosts were \"expressly forbidden from discussing gun control,\" New York Magazine quotes anonymous sources as saying:","According to sources, David Clark, the executive producer in charge of Fox’s weekend coverage, gave producers instructions not to talk about gun-control policy on air. \"This network is not going there,” Clark wrote one producer on Saturday night, according to a source with knowledge of the exchange. The directive created a rift inside the network. ","Fox News of course is part of News Corp, where the boss, Rupert Murdoch, strongly favors \"bold leadership action\" on gun control. At least that's what the Rupert Murdoch on Twitter wants. It's unclear whether he's willing to risk the bottom line of Fox News by encouraging the network (or he could simply instruct them) to hew to basic journalistic praxis and cover what is a central aspect of the story at hand.","Nice words from POTUS on shooting tragedy, but how about some bold leadership action?","The author of the NY Mag piece, Gabriel Sherman, notes that the apparent omerta on gun control wasn't absolute, as Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace had Democratic Senators Joe Lieberman and Dick Durbin on to talk about gun control.","5.28pm ET","The Guardian's Matt Williams has been reaching out to pro-gun senators to ask them for comment on Friday's tragedy and whether new gun control laws are needed:","Of the 28 senators and members-elect approached – all of whom have been given an “A” grade from the National Rifle Association (NRA) for their pro-gun views - only one has given a response thus far, although incoming senator Ted Cruz's people said he is travelling and may speak to us later.","Which leaves Senator Richard Shelby as the only politician to respond. A spokesman for the senior Republican senator from Alabama said: “He believes we must consider any proposals very carefully.”","Although he made far briefer comments to the media today than those from Joe Manchin and Mark Warner – two Democrat senators with NRA “A” ratings who have suggested they are open to the new gun rules - Shelby appears to be the first pro-gun Republican to indicate a willingness to engage in a discussion.","Update: Matt has just received a response via email from a spokesperson for Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia. The senator says the attack \"should cause us to pause and take stock\" but he does not mention gun control or new gun laws. He does mention \"school security\":","First and foremost, I send my deepest condolences to the families of the victims of the school shooting in Newtown. This terrible tragedy and the other similar mass shootings in recent years should cause us to pause and take stock. After 9/11, we came together to see what we could do to prevent another attack. The work of the 9/11 Commission made flying safer and has helped us prevent another hijacking of a U.S. plane by terrorists.We should evaluate in a thoughtful process gun safety, mental health, school security and all other components that contributed to this horrendous act of violence.","Updated at 5.40pm ET","4.59pm ET","Why won't politicians vote for stricter gun laws? Because the National Rifle Association will trash them and they'll never win another election. The calculation may be brutal but there's a logic to it.","Except it's patently untrue: politicians who defy the NRA don't necessarily lose, and politicians who kowtow to the gun lobby don't necessarily win. ","Even in states with large Republican populations, politicians who support gun control can win big. The New Republic's Nate Cohn points to two cases: Tim Kaine has a rating of \"F\" from the NRA and just won a Virginia Senate election by 6 points; Bill Nelson also received an \"F\" and just won a Florida Senate election by 13 points. Here's a scan of a flier in which the NRA attacks Nelson – it turns out ineffectually.","Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts, meanwhile, had an \"A\" from the NRA before losing to Elizabeth Warren last month by 7 points.","Defying the NRA works in national elections, too. The NRA has never gone after a candidate like it did Barack Obama, Slate's Dave Weigel points out: ","@electionate Also, they went all out against Obama twice and he kicked their asses twice.","The Guardian's Harry J.
